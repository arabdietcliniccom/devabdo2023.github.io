== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How will Staatic improve the performance of my site? =

Staatic will convert your dynamic WordPress site into a static site consisting of HTML assets, images, scripts and other assets. By removing WordPress (and even PHP) from the equation, requested pages from your site can be served instantly, instead of having to be generated on the fly.

= Why not use a caching plugin? =

Caching plugins are great to improve the performance of your site as well, however they (usually) don’t remove WordPress itself from the stack, which adds additional latency.

Also by using Staatic, you are free to host your site anywhere. You could for example choose a very fast cloud provider or content delivery network, providing even more performance.

= Will the appearance of my site change? =

No. At least, it should not. If the static version of your site does differ, it is probably because of invalid HTML in your original WordPress site, which could not be converted correctly. In that case you can verify the validity of your HTML using a validator service like [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

= How will Staatic improve the security of my site? =

Since your site is converted into static HTML pages, the attack surface is greatly reduced. That means less need to worry about keeping WordPress, plugins and themes up-to-date.

= Is Staatic compatible with all plugins? =

Unfortunately not. Because your site is converted into a static site, dynamic server side functions are not available. Plugins that require this, for example to process forms, retrieve data externally etc., do not work out of the box, or are not supported at all.

You will need to make modifications to make such features work, or you can choose Staatic Premium which adds such functionality automatically. For more information, please visit [staatic.com](https://staatic.com/wordpress/).

= Will it work on shared or (heavily) restricted servers? =

Staatic has been optimized to work in most environments. The major requirements are that the plugin is able to write to the work directory and connect to your WordPress installation.

= Where can I get help? =

If you have any questions or problems, please have a look at our [documentation](https://staatic.com/wordpress/documentation/) and [FAQ](https://staatic.com/wordpress/faq/) first.

If you cannot find an answer there, feel free to open a topic on our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/staatic/).

2. Monitor the status of your publications while they happen and review details of past publications to easily troubleshoot any issues.
3. Configure and fine tune the way Staatic processes your site to suit your specific needs.
